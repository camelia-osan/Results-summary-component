# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

### Table of contents

[Challange]

"Your challenge is building out this results summary component and getting it as close to the design as possible. 
We provide the data for the results in a local "data.json" file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content"


[My process]

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query
- JavaScript Document Object Model methods

I decided to use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS for this project. I wrote the code for the structure and design of the project myself, using just pure CSS. I used Flexbox for a more efficient way to design and arrange elements, and Media Query to make sure the component is displayed right, regardless of the screen size.
I chose to check the bonus part too, so I used the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content with JavaScript, making use of the HTML DOM methods.
